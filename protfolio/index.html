                        First I will give you some little info about myself - I am a student of BCA 4th Semester and soon after main exams I will be in 5th sem. There is no campus placement system for us in our university so after 6th sem we will be on our own and searching jobs is not cup of tea for a fresher who is from a small city and don't know from where to start, unlike big cities one. So here is what I had done till now.
    
    I had already started creating my resume when I was in 1st sem and give some hours in making it good,I had done it due to curiosity but it is important if you are gonna be in private sector. Back in time I had done some 3 certification short term courses(16 months diploma im PDCAM from a private learning center and 2 months certificate course on C++ & DOEACC CCC ) Which I thought will be of no use in future but now I came to know their importance as in resume it add some extra good terms in your qualification area .Also I had learned many things while doing it.
